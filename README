Simple SSHFS wrapper for movie/disk server

Use ONLY on LAN, and be sure you trust those on your LAN.
Requires Pike 7.8 or greater.

If you want to have a Linux NAS for music, movies or any Write Once Read Many
collection, and you want to access it with your normal file manager, then SSHFS
could be the tool for you! But suppose you want grant read-only access to your
family or housemates, and you don't want them to have to enter a password each
time... the configuration can be a little involved. This project gives a few
helpers, but most importantly, this guide should walk you through everything.

Setup:

TODO: Flesh out instructions and explanations

You will need two user accounts on the server - one with read/write access, to
add new content, and one with read-only access that most people will use.
These instructions assume a functional Linux system with Pike installed.

- Create new account 'merlin' (or your choice), create .ssh/authorized_keys,
  clean out everything else in ~ and mark it all read-only except authorized_keys
- Put content in folder NOT owned by merlin, as only child of root-owned directory
- If mount point is to be on non-boot drive, add it to /etc/fstab
- Ensure that account has read-only access to mount point
- Test at this point - run auth.pike as root, download script on client and run
- Lock password: sudo usermod -U merlin
- Set shell to a not-shell: sudo usermod -s /bin/true merlin
- Adjust merlin.conf as necessary and copy to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
